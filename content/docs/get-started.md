Before we dive in, let's make sure you are ready.

### What do you need?

* You need to be able to install software on your computer. This is so you can install the CLI, or Command Line Interface, a program used to interact with Cloud Foundry.

* You should be comfortable using a terminal and working with simple command line tools. Codecademy has a great tutorial on the command line if you feel like you need some practice before continuing with this tutorial: [https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line).

* You will sign up for a Cloud Foundry account on a hosted provider. The providers all offer free trials.

### Conventions

**Code Blocks**: We will use code blocks to denote commands run in the terminal window as well as examples of output from the commands. The following example expects you to run the `pwd` command.

  ```sh
  pwd
  ```

  We also use code blocks to show representative output from running commands. For example, if you run `pwd` above, you can expect to see output similar to:

  ```
  /Users/steve/workspace
  ```

**Variables**: In the instructions, we place variables inside of less than `<` and greater than `>` keys. You should supply your specific values in place of these blocks. For example, if you see `<USERNAME>` in a code block, you should replace it with your username.
