You need a Cloud Foundry instance to use. If your company has a Cloud Foundry instance, you should use that. Of course you can run Cloud Foundry yourself, but in the interest of time, you can also pick one of the hosted solutions below. Follow the sign up instructions for the provider you select.

*There are other providers with hosted Cloud Foundry solutions. Feel free to use any provider you would like. We recommend the following because they have simple sign up processes and free trials.*
